dot be mad after I said australia sucks
the general public asked
and then I'll beat my mum in poker
anyways I get my poker set tomorrow

I really like to forget useless informations
( an entire continent )
that'd mean germany had more citizens than australia
don't they have only 30 million
what
and kangaroos
time zone
I liked the part best where it showed things not related to Australia
we watched a video about Australia and it showed pictures of Australia
why tf are you gaming
anyways 6 people is enoguh to have a great game
+ 2 friends of mine that might also play
we're 4
and with chee, dog, you, me
you only need 2 persons for a tournament
<@207646629140889601>
apperantly
it's a thing
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_dice
with 300 chips
nah it says poker set
Texas Hold'em doesn't have dices
is there a poker game with dice?
also why does my poker set include dice
you can play Poker with money stashes and bowls
the left guy look in the wrong direction
4th one
there we go
since it thinks im a time
it'd be better if you'd use niclas and not 6am
this is so weird
dumbass che
first one is not even 1% related
second one is the best
risk everything and then win everything with my money monopol
then my tactic wouldn't work
It gets really funni when you hve more than 6 people
you played very weird
but I think you were mostly the reason why I had so much
no offense
Dog
yeah I lost against him a bunch of times
ikd like 8k
wanted to leave

i know 2 more people that I think can play poker
<@207646629140889601> if we find enough people we can do a tournament
what's intended stack
that's because it is
OK I'm down now
imma make myself a toast and then we can play
indeed
no good
I literally drank half the bottle of the cinder and now my stomach aches a little bit
yeah
your uni people remind me of him
Sean Parker
Napster
which then got sued for copyright infringement on multiple occasions
the guy who founded the software that allowed you to listen to music online
this reminds me of the friend of Mark Zuckerberg
it even looks good
yeah
yeah but as you already said, I'm only gonna use it for poker, so
Holy fuck
it's the stupidest shit ever
lmao I helped a friend with some school stuff once and after we were done we talked and she stated that she doesn't know why she drinks alcohol
yeah it looks cool but 20 bucks is a bit much
Holy fuck it has vr
free ones
any alternatives that are as good?
Holy fuck
how much is it
if there were more people like you guys on my school id also have way more friends
many like-minded people
you're going to uni
this should be easy asf for you
is this like where I setup a camera?
family and friends
ok my poker set is arriving on Tuesday
ok got that
oh
first person sets 1 chip as small blind,
second one sets 2 chips as big blind,

third one calls,
first one folds,
second one calls,
flop is revealed,
third one checks,
second one checks,
turn is revealed,
third one checks,
second one checks,
river is revealed,
third one checks,
second one checks,
cards are revealed
ok so example again
and the blinds are only paid in the first round?
if everyone checks the round just finishes without anyone betting, right?
flop happend, what happens next
Ok
after the first round, the first 3 public cards are revealed?
so I got that
oh good
first person sets 1 chip as small blind,
second person sets 2 chips as big blind,
third person raises to 6 chips,
first person calls,
second person folds,
third person checks
ok so example again
if I agree to a raise?
is that called checking then?
yeah because it got raised
and next round the second and third person would set the small and big blind
would this work?
3 person playing 1 game
first person sets 1 chip as small blind,
second one sets 2 chips as big blind,
third one calls and sets 2 chips,
first one raises and sets 6 chips,
second one calls and sets 6 chips
ok lemme give an example to verify
so the dealer gets to choose the big blind?
what are thr amounts of small and big blind?
ok i got that ig
and the 2 people that set the small and big blind just skip the round?
good I got that
so if I call after the big blind was set from ghe previous person im setting the big blind?
good
and small blind is the lowest?
so big blind is just all chips that are in the game
highest bet
so the small blind is the start amount?
that's why I'm asking
I just know the very basics
nah
I know that it's a thing in Texas hold em
yeah but what does that mean
ehat does blibd mean in this context
I didnt understand what that means
Casino Poker Chip Set,300PCS Poker Chips with Aluminum Case,11.5 Gram Chips for Texas Holdem Blackjack Gambling https://a.co/d/8hEhPjP
<@207646629140889601> what do you think of this
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge
also <@207646629140889601> can I play poker with bridge cards
1 shot of it and 3 of tonic
friend of mine had it yesterday
already sounds disgusting ngl
bitter liquor with 30%
it is
or is that a german thing
<@207646629140889601> so you know Ramazzotti
egg liquor
Eierlik�r
no idea
even though it's not wine
and cider apperantly Apfelwein
we just call that Apfelschorle
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein
so it's my fault
that translates to cider
and that is apple wine
mum said its Apfelwein
OH I KNOW WHY
nah
it also tastes like the memory I have of wine
mum said it's wine
but this wine taste is disgusting
it has apple mixed with it
the rhubarb taste is OK
I got some red rhubarb wine rn and this wine taste is so fucking disgusting
what do you think of wine
it's literally disgusting
wine tastes like shit
mh
as an example: I get a J and a 10, the program tells me that there is a possibility of a royal flush
since if I know I got a good set and at least a small chance of a full house, I can make decision faster and probably with less error quote
I think it could be
if I get a pair my chances of a full house, a three/four of a kind are higher than if I don't get one
It can
1 round starts, get your 2 cards, which you then enter into the program, the program then proceeds to tell you the chance of getting a royal flush, flush etc. and if you should call of fold, if you call, you proceed to enter thr 3 public cards and it tells you again, how good your chances of winning are, and if you should call of fold
ok lemme give you a better explanation
and if it's a website you just select the card
either if it's a cli tool with your keyboard by pressing the according numbers, with the type and the value as format
then you cab input the public deck and it'll give you more statistics
you give the program your deck and it calculated the chance of getting a good hand
poker statistics
so basically
ttun gamer, I got an idea and I need you to rate it
being rude is not a very top g behavior of you

hey dot what's the distance to x
I bet I could just do the
so it's basically just searching for a tool and then entering information
that do the circle stuff
there are tools iirc
yeah but I don't really care that much so
I can surely do ot
any distance is OK, if it's on Google maps
I mean stuff like distance from some big ass cities on goopfe maps
nah
they have more than 3 point though ig
google has a tool that does it via latencies
not really
yeah but I need to find him myself
and then creating/using software to locate him
specifically 3
asking dot how far he is from certain cities
I got an idea
Ok so ttun

<@207646629140889601> what is on your mind rn
TTUN, we need to eat
. . .
tun
.-
first request was successfully converted to typera
Sir Ttun
no
( they make the big money )
L8 engineer
the name basiclally says it, it's in te middle of the clinet and the handler
yes
it's a function that runs before you actually handle the request
```js\nhandle("/capybara", () => {\n     // This'd be the middleware\n     const user = getUser()\n})\n```
it basically like this
instead of having the same code for all the routes that require the user, you just put a middleware in front of it
You have multiple requests which require the user to be authenticated, so in this case, you'd need to get the token and then request the user in the database always in the handler
not having to write the same code 100 times over and over
( the request contains the token )
yes
and in the handler I can then access the uer
runs before this code becaue I defined it as middleware
this code
middleware runs before the actual code of the request, so you can inject stuff like user
then runs middleware and after that executes actual code
gamer.com sees: TTUN SENT MESSAGE  ! !!  !!
you send request to gamer.com
OK so
It's the simplest shit ( I knew this when I first touched express ( with 11 ) )
and I wrote middleware
I drank water
. . . ttun
you're quite literally personality shaming me rn
you're quite literally typo shaming me rn
