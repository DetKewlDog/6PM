OMG I could listen to my keyboard for days. It sounds so "thocky" and "smooth" at the same time.
Indeed.
Researching such list must've taken years.
Nice! Well done.
Tuner a decision has been made: I will try technical analysis; as I am very lazy and don't have much time, I will code a bot that automates it for me.

Hi Chee! I got my brand new keyboard.
Also your challenge was easy to pass: I just had to use it for an hour, to then tell you about the great experience. Remember, you updated the terms to that I need to have used it for a "while", which I did.
<@207646629140889601> I have to tell you one important thing: You do not even need to download software; it is all managed via a website - no pun intended. The software is called "VIA" and works both as application and on the web. It allows me to change the layout, the lighting and more.
Oh no! You should really spend the rest of the day being productive.
Now I can finally get to doing technical writing.
10/10, can only recommend.
This keyboard has a great out of the box experience. The greatest sound from a keyboard that wasn't modded.

This is a bit longer, good to mention though, that this isn't what is used at berufsschule, but just made for fun by a private person, as you see when you go to the domain without any other routes
we have a so called Ausbildung, which teaches you all the shit for a specific job, this ausbildung is done at a Berufsschule (literally job-school, vocational school), once you graduate from there, you can call yourself a Network Engineer.
are cables really the latest shit, that this info didn't exist in 2011? And didn't networks already exists in 2011?
good to mention: this is from a gymnasium (the thing that comes after 10th grade), in an intensified course
I think it has info about bandwidth but nothing more
https://www.bremer-turnverband.de/sites/default/files/files/GrundlagenNetzwerke.pdf had to find it, as I usually close my tabs, Netzwerkgrundlagen means network basics btw
6 or 7
but not ever cable, fiber wasn't mentioned
One did, yes
curriculum, and the pdf resources unis provide for learning (these were probably too advanced for vocational school, but I thing they shouldn't contain less infos)
Agentur f√ºr Arbeit, and the pdfs I've overflown
Redirection the physics guy after asking for explanation about fiber cable still does it for me
just in time
possible, but take into consideration that we talked about subnets for more than 2 hours, while we looked at cables for 10 minutes - seems like it either isn't important to tell me that, or they didn't know it
about certain topics
Oh also a probabal indication for me to think that, that I was redirected to the physics guy when I asked about how fiber exactly worked
I mean it was a shit load of information of singular topics, so I am assuming that ( this bombarding took a day of my time in the internship)
They did, but about the topics that they wanted to talk about with me, which included cables
either even they found it useless or they didn't know. everything else would just be weird asf.
I could ask the same for Subnets, which I definitely won't need and they knew, still got a lot of informations about them
They explained everything in great detail, would be weird if that's the only stuff they refused to tell me in detail, wouldn't it?
I understand your point, that's why I wrote that they don't affect the knowledge **of a network engineer**, as they're (hot guess) probably physical and not network related
Might be, but I highly doubted they learned stuff about the cable types. My internship was partly very network specific, and they explained a lot of stuff about networking, including cable stuff, but never mentioned how they're built, why they work or anything else - again, I doubt that's because they just didn't want to tell me, but because they don't know it. I was told though, to use cables mostly resistant against interference in any way, which should be specified in the cables description
You told us a shit lot about magnetic interference
I did, but I don't see where the completely physical layer of why the cables are twisted, provide any other knowledge relevant to a network engineers work
In pretty sure you exactly learned why that is, while a normal network engineer needs to know, that they better not place cable x near a microwave
Same thing, you need to know property x, automatically adds property y
You're telling me I need to know, if a cable has property x, it also has property y. I agree with that, but not with requiring the knowledge of how they work
and how does that include the knowledge of how it works?
This sounds like they need to know how much bandwidth and speed a cable can do, doesn't it?
Ok lemme generalize, barely any networking engineer, that isn't doing hyper unusual stuff, requires this knowledge
I don't mention how smart I am, I just disagree with tuner on this fucking topic as no one needs it
I just find it very weird that this isn't (or just barely) mentioned anywhere on the pdfs (btw. used by vocational schools) I'm reading
with whether it fits their switch, I meant the form factor since I highly doubt that the cables I have seen, that look like normal lan, don't fit my 20 buck tplink switch
the people that use the cable should know the maximum speed of the cable and whether it fits their switch
I think people that engineer cables should know this
you just don't need it
but sampling together multiple big ass pdfs of network basics that also don't or barely mention cables is pretty weird
don't worry, Aventura f√ºr Arbeit is pretty accurate when it comes to that stuff
and in my experience network engineers doesn't know it either (again, sampling size of 2, 5 people)
I looked at 15 job listing, what is required to pass vocational school, what the job listing that don't require vocational school require (e.g. network basics), and I haven't found a single source of what tuner has studied
troubleshooting, support, fixing problems
manage networks, build networks
network engineer
I mean that's what you studied, isn't i
the ones I got to know didn't know it, but that's a sampling size of 2
What do you think, does a network engineer require exact knowledge of how each cable is built and functions?
anyways I found 4 more pdfs about basic networking, 3 don't even mention the cables, 1 mentions how one is built with a small image on the side
I mean most of the basic math stuff was used in the last 5 math exams
(final exams of vocational school)
even the final exams of the last 5 years just ask the names of 3 cables
tuner doesn't seem to agree that you don't need that knowledge, like, ever
exactly
not how they're built
and not gone further into, just knowing that they exist
Ok I looked deeper into it. All the cable types are on one page üíÄ

Nah, the job listing told that they require that
I think they should know what they teach students
they're no company but a official agency
the state guys that help you find a job, send you money when you don't got a job, give informations about classes, uni, jobs etc.
nothing but the default shit like you should know what a packet is
even looked at multiple websites
since many mentioned "Basics of Networkengineering", I googled exactly that
I used stepstone for the job research, and then I looked at the official information from the Agentur f√ºr Arbeit for what they teach in school
Go look for yourself, I'll provide you with all the resources you need, if they're too hard to find
you just wont accept it somehow
I mean go look for yourself üíÄI'm not stating that they don't require it just because I think that rn
nothing more
Your knowledge is useless
You're right. They all required a thing in network management. So I checked what you learn there - no cables
and I didnt only check smaller companies
no one required knowledge of cables
OK I checked 15 companies and what they require you to work for them
now he just manages and fixes stuff
he built the network, positioned all repeaters, even custom made ones, placed every switch (with his team), connected each cable
the other network engineers doesn't manage such a big network, but I'm certain he doesn't know that
I mean if you can manage a network with more than 8k clients and multiple subnets + vlans, thousands of switches and servers, without that knowledge, I highly doubt you really need it
so not just a small person doing random stuff at a small company
oh btw he was managing a big ass data center network
worked with 3 network engineers, the department manager couldn't even tell me how fiber works, and yet, earns 120k per year
tell me

I've treated myself to a new keyboard
I bought a new keyboard
yes of course
oh also expensive
swagger hardly recognizes 7
there are about 1.34 million ways to write an api
Oh recommendation: IBM Model M
oh also it only costs 60 bucks
<:pain:923203371249336361> the c2 is 100% but doesn't have a Nordic layout
yes + entirely out of aluminum (no plastic) and south facing lights
oh also hot swappable
the reason why I paid 150 bucks for it is because I bought from a reseller (the official iso-de were all sold out), the actual keyboard costs 120 bucks, which is the maxed out configuration (aluminum frame, rgb backlight and garmen brown/red switches)
allows you to change the entire keyboard keys the way you want + it has a processor so you can disconnect the keyboard and use it wireless while still having your configured layout
there is a reason why I can only recommend the k8: VIA and the other thing ai forgot
at least my corsair keyboard which I bought for 150 bucks was conplete bullshit (didn't sound good, didn't feel good, stabilizers were absolutely bullshit)
same goes for corsair and Roccat
and if I am not mistaken, the k3 is half the price
and in my opinion (just like the headphone thing), comparing a keychron (I only compared a k3) with a razer huntsman, the keychron wins every time
Keychron is actually good as they care about how their keyboard feels and looks, they build in mods (like dampeners and steel plates), to make their keyboard the best possible out of the box experience
https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-iso-jis-keyboard-collection/products/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard-german-iso-de-layout

When you buy the product, you get a license key and a download option, so you download the app, and then enter the license key into the app to activate it.

No

CORS is a browser-side security measure
yes
I'm VERY bad at explaining, especially in english
hope you at least kinda got a clue of what this is about
(referring to the last paragraph)
the same goes for frontends, because of form submissions, commonly used on php-websites, which are still pretty dominant
Cors blocks every request sent via javascript when the origin of the request (e.g. my website) isn't allowed in the policies. To check this, the browser sends a so-called preflight request to every url you're requesting, which returns the allowed origins in the headers. If the origin is in this origin-header, the browser will continue to send the javascript request, if not, it blocks it.
When you're opening a session though, the browser just sends a request and doesn't do the preflight, as the browser knows that there is no origin website that might have a malicious intent.
If this security measure wasn't there, I could just tell the browser to send a javascript request to any api, and if you're logged into that api (e.g. via cookies), you're fucked
kinda
but not if my website sends an http request. You accessing Fiverr via the search function is different than accessing it via javascript
your website says send request to fiverr, browser does a so-called preflight, which checks the cors policies. Fiverrs policy says only to allows requests from fiverr.com, so it blocks your actual request
also protected by cors
I can't send the request on the client side, it just gets blocked.
Fiverr will surely have a Cors policy that will only allow client request from fiverr.com. if this wouldn't exist, this would result in chaos.
Let's take a bank as example.
You go on my website, and are logged into your chase account. So I get smart and send a request to the chase-transact-money endpoint, and am now richers. CORS prevents this
real time would be pretty important as long response times are stupid and not beneficial. So each account on my platform requires maybe 5 socket connection. Only 100 users seems like the expenses would rise to the moon (I am assuming that websockets consume a bit of performance, which might not be true)
expensive; the server would require enormous amounts of bandwidths, sending the request via the client also wouldn't work due to cors, managing many accounts is also pretty hard especially if these platforms don't have publicly available apis
these massive amounts of data are extremely expensive to scrape
that's why my stock idea failed
expensive
also A probably would require some kind of data, as that's (at least my) main usecase of apis
A doesn't seem like a thing you could show an hr person
B is like my casual side projects, which never get finished
C is extremely hard to find an idea for
specifically want a web project though, as that's the easiest to make, considering support for all platforms

read a 500 page book on databases
they are
is it directly reading the files or translating to SEQUEL
what's the underlying database
<@698374767043936327> do you have any idea, why disk-management softwares prefer to make 3 volumes (one the primary, and the other 2 extended volumes, each with a size of n/3), instead of 1 big partition?
Of course it helps to work more efficiently, still creates a dependency, and doesn't teach you the way of speaking and writing proficiently.
Writing is also a soft-skill one can use in person-to-person chats, as the skill of writing surely does affect the skill of talking.
I still find it not sustainable to use it for blogs. There always is a risk of it not doing what it used to do. Dependencies in this niche doesn't seem peccant, in my opinion.
If we take into consideration, that this is just a marketing stunt, we can be sure of the fact that this won't be free forever.
So dividends on stocks of big companies are low?
Such a loss would cover all of that earnings.
OpenAI is a private company, so there barely is a financial overview, but I personally doubt that they earn more than a billion per year.
Let's take a VERY big company to "visualize" how impossible this is: Nike has a net earning of 6 billion dollars. The loss that OpenAI is enduring right now, would be 1/6 of Nike, which is around 15%. Such loss would result in a disaster - yes, even for Nike.
I think this is impossible. You need to see how much 3 million a day really is. Calculating an entire year with each day loosing 3 million dollar, results in a loss of 1.095.000.000. This is an impeccable, even for most bigger companies.
I am full of doubt thinking about this idea; OpenAI already announced that they're loosing around 3 million dollar a day. This doesn't seem like a profitable model.
I need to get into technical writing; a nice way of pursuing this would be a blog on the platform "HashNode". Sadly, writing detailed blog-articles takes time, and software like ChatGPT is, in my opinion, not a sustainable opinion, since it makes my blog dependent on a software, of which I can not control whether it will continue to run for affordable prices, or will stop working completely. OpenAI already announced that they plan on implementing a way of watermarking the generated texts - This would be the end of my blog. Taking all this into consideration, learning how to write proficiently is the smartest idea.
I just like bullshitting Tuner from time to time.
This doesn't even work for me, as I am luckily not a citizen of the USA.

<@207646629140889601> As I have already told you, I was eating at a Chinese restaurant today. So this restaurant had a kind of "tradition": Once a customer sits down, they deliver a "Schnapps" (Alcoholic drink) for the adults, and Fanta (Soda-Drink without alcohol) for the kids. As I am literally the adultest adult, I obviously got the Schnapps, which I had to refuse, as I do not want to commit a federal crime; needless to say, the waitress was shocked...

I have astonishing 2 hours of experience in Adobe Illustrator. I highly doubt you really want me to create a logo for you.
Meaning the next tool I will have to learn (after I collected some experience in Illustrator)  is InDesign.
Ok so apparently, Brand Identities are made with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign.
Didn't imagine Illustrator to be this easy.
Custom Typography.
Are you paying 720‚Ç¨ per year for Adobe Creative Cloud
Hello!
Sadly, I do not remember a joke which, as a matter of fact, I tried to tell round about 2 months ago.
I think that was because the joke wasn't funny anymore when translated to English.
she makes very nice videos of stuff
This woman is great

and they harm the enviourment as trees have to DIE for them.
also I tend to loose paper sheets as they suck
so I can study all that shit better
Tuner... I am just putting my notes into Notion ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I am preparing now, as I have to take them in around 1.75 years.
3 subjects are mandatory: math, english and German.
We have to additionally choose 2 other subjects, one of then has to be chemistry, physics or biology.
I will be taking physics and economics.
Hey tuner! In one year I have to take my final exams.
tuner could never...

A nice silver watch seems to be an all-rounder for me though.
Of course a simple 20‚Ç¨ Casio can look good depending on your clothes.
I do think these watches are extremely good looking, especially with a nice suit.
https://youtu.be/3V5sjI7OVK4
Many higher prices watches also provide more features. My watch for example has a Tachymeter, a timer, and tells the date.
You need to take into consideration that watches, in our modern society, aren't just there to tell time, but also to look good, as they are an accessory.
Needless to mention, nice looking automatic watches start at around 400‚Ç¨ in my opinion; automatic is according to many people with expertise on watches, preferable due to it's durability and no battery.
And most of the really good looking watches start at 150‚Ç¨, but this is just my opinion - I just haven't seen a watch that was below this price point that fitted my image of a nice looking watch.
I had more than 30 watches on my wrist now, so I think I can confidentially tell you, that the 15‚Ç¨ Casio watch substantially felt worse on my wrist than a 500‚Ç¨ Glashaus watch.
Looks nice, in most cases pretty high quality
Looks nice, not automatic though.
Hes getting a Tommy Hilfiger watch for 200‚Ç¨ now.
The main intention of visiting that store was to find a nice watch for a friend. Well, as you might've guessed, this idea dipped.
Very nice indeed.
The watch was nice though.
Sadly, the store wasn't selling Rolex Watches, otherwise I would've looked at a Rolex Hulk.
OK tuner story time: We had a class excursion this Monday, and naturally, I had a suit on; we went to the cinema and afterwards shopping. There was a nice jeweler and a watch store. Of course I had to visit them. So I walk into the store and the first thing the women did was come up to me and talk to me about watches. They really were ready to sell my 15 year old ass a 3k Omega Watch.
I spent way too much on them
anyways I have 6 suit-shirts now
I don't think we are meant to talk in class unless advised so
as I prefer to have my mouth shut in class
the thing said I'm a lone wolf in class
this isn't true
(unbelievably tasty and delicious)
(I will be having BBQ pizza)
Hey Dot! I'm negotiating to make pizza today.
Inspiration - that's the keyword....
... truly a dot moment.
It seems like there are only like 30 things you need to know to be able to do basically anything.
Illustrator is relatively easy to use.
that's OK pricing, taking to consideration that only Illustrator normally costs 20 buck per month
Oh also for Students Creative Cloud costs 20 buck per month in the first year, and 30 buck a year after the first year
It really gives value to one's life.
You should learn Illustrator too, I think.
I think I am now ready to attempt my first logo.
I watched a shit ton of videos of people making brand designs and identities in illustrator yesterday
happy morning tuner
bruh

OH NO
How do you have photoshop..
How much do your parents pay for Photoshop
Did you crack it
<@535483016546615302> How much do you pay for Photoshop
I will now get my head around Illustrator.
Everyone agrees. He posted some unfunny stuff in here.
Not funny.

might have been just a special offer for a limited time though
No,but if I recall correctly they have some free forever
Tuner should rethink his moral compass.
No. Always.
why are you always so mean
we should rename homeless people to urban survival specialists.
thats 24 buck a year
A mail server costs you maybe 2 buck a month
and have a server
yes
+ It's swiss so that's a big plus (Rolex is also swiss)
otherwise Proton seems nice

Very Good!
Why are you always so mean
the guys I know that own a shit ton of real estate had millions beforehand
How would you get into real estate
+ my watch wouldn't have costed 350 but 700 buck
I just know it isn't Swiss as this would've been the first thing the watch dealer would've told me
highly doubt
I could legitimately throw up..
mine sadly isn't Swiss <:pain:923203371249336361> <:pain:923203371249336361> <:pain:923203371249336361> <:pain:923203371249336361>

also Swiss
Patek Phillep is also a great watch maker

Depends on the model, if I recall correctly a Submariner gained 20k in value those year, don't know the model though (saw it on shorts)

Tuner a Rolex is not very volatile.
Preferably into something physical (e.g. a Rolex or Gold)
I think you should invest your money.

I forgot to mention that I will also install Illustrator today.
OH also I kinda got insider information on medicine stocks right now (FOR LEGAL PURPOSES: I DO NOT CONDONE INSIDER TRADING AND I DO NOT HAVE THIS INFORMATION)
Good. Am going to work for like an hour now, then reset a pc, then try to recover an old wordpress installation from one of them scam hosters, then go to a big city, then buy stuff, then go home, then dance, then finish the website I am making for a friend who is starting through
 with influencer marketing and management, then dance, then sleep
Tuner...
is that so?
the word "fuck" was used 559 times in The Wolf of Wallstreet

oh also I'm not actually paying for it
wouldn't even work in my 720‚Ç¨/year plan
luckily I'm not doing any team work
so I can make my own serif font and try to make some logos
I'm just there for illustrator
what is it ????
<@207646629140889601> I got Adobe Creative Cloud now
Notion is better anyways
If I want it to sync I'd need to pay 60 bucks a year
I tried to get that shit on my phone and I literally had to install git and then clone my repository + find the directory where git cloned it to
THAT IS THE WORST

there are many perfect numbers

dot....
This was what I meant, I would support your idea if you actually had experience building a community as it is requires for such a project
big servers can so that, and (at least german programming servers) are doing it, but no one cares about whether little tuner has a discord bot on his server with 2 active people
and people don't come from nothing
if you want something like this to work you need people
I mean you can waste your time on the bot but I bet 10 bucks that there will be no one using it except for maybe revengewizard
as there is no need
this bot would be an extremely big time waster
you have 0 mildy successful projects and no experience in marketing and/or a media presence
even dot server obly has 3 active people and he has a midly successful project
requires an active community
lmao I really dont give a fuck about that points, it's about spam and crypto ads
really great!
now look at this:
```js\nconst TEXT="This is my bullshit text!"\n```
this server has maybe 3 active people and one of them is me
all this would require at least a small active community
remember that a bot reporting me wod require ai, which I don't think you want to fund
I can still post a lot of bullshit but not get any points
big programming discords would require thousands of mods üíÄüíÄ
doesn't scale though
manyal verification is the only thing that would work w
for you
I can do that too with a discord form, by just putting a commit tag inside the message, but with the benefit that I can also post about my private repositories, or if I am a beginner about my progress without having to know git
discord allows bots to have buttons which can open a modal
üíÄ
especially for beginners
discord forms would be way easier
using github is just an unnecessary extra step
exactly as much as I can put bullshit in JavaScript
Ican out bullshit in markdown
read this
This idea is the exact same as just having a discord bot that allows you to click a button which opens a form where you can enter your info but stupider and with an extra step
checking this would require heavy use of ai
also markdown would habe to be allowed as people might be posting changelogs
barely possible
how exactly would you do that?
I could push every bullshit in there as github is just a version control interface and doesn't necessarily require code
this was just an example
I create a github repository -> add a markdown file called stocks.md, automatically update this file -> send to bot -> programming update with my stocks
I can create a public repository and post updates on how my stocks are doing; if you implement that system where someone has to verify your content, there is a useless extra step as this can easily be done without having a github repo
this idea isn't very smart

I mean the results of the strong üí™ üòÖ german school system are greatly presented at the Pisa studies

doesn't work for freelancing either as you will get yourself underpriced as fuck

which you normally don't have
we wrote half a page of text for that bullshit just for me to find out that not even I won't need it as it is extremely based on a lot of history data
I confused the thing; I meant equilibrium price
I mean you gotta know the exact definition of price as much as you gotta know your network cables

I think you might be confusing something here - Tensorflow is a library for machine learning, while I am talking about so-called "no-code" tools.
Almost. I would've used Typeform anyways, as it gives the best form experience, in my humble opinion.
My main focus lays on the Zapier part. Zapier allows you to create worksflows, which is like a program flow.
Here's a quick workflow example: Typeflow send a notification to Zapier. Zapier notices that and runs my workflow: The workflow is like a program flow, but it has nodes defined and not syntax elements. In this example the first node is a "Send Email" Node, which then gives you 2 ways to connect more nodes (ran successfully, error occurred), and so forth.
You should look into it.
I have decided that no-code is in many cases a better option than coding it completely yourself. 
For my client testimonials I am using Typeform, which automatically sends a notification to Zapier. Zapier then continues to save the testimonial to an Airtable and send me an email.
Writing this myself would've probably taken 1 hour or even longer, while this setup took me 5 minutes or less.
Zapier is a SaaS (Software as a Service) product, which allows for no-code integration with over 5000 integrations. A possible usecase might be to write to a database when a new user registers.
Airtable is such a "database", which also allows for no-code automation. A possible usecase might be to store users.
To summarize, I am talking about the no-code movement.
Why don't you have an opinion on this uprising topic?
<@207646629140889601> what is your opinion on platforms like Zapier and Airtable?
He has been accused of third degree murder in several cases.

I would file a lawsuit and move to a judicial court, because this violates the so-called "DSGVO", and it is a case under private law, so no higher court is necessary.

Hello <@698374767043936327> üëã ü´Ç
First day results are astonishing! 3 organic followers, with around 30 tweets!
oops
oh and I can generate money by selling to my following once I got a following
because there are many people who made it in life and teach you valuable things
I think quote tweets are a pretty nice tool to gain a following, as it pushes your tweet onto many peoples timelines, once the quoted person likes the tweet. This is assuming the quoted person has a big following.
Many Twitter-Users always like their replies, so this might be a pretty good strategy.
My goal for today is to gain 10 followers. I am applying techniques that I've learned from successful tweeters.
I need to learn copywriting, as it's the key point of marketing - if you are a good writer, the chances are good for you to become a marketer.
**only** executables are all the same - just files. 
You probably mean the experience with using programs, which isn't only dependent on the executable type.
I honestly think, for basic consumers Windows has the best experience, since it allows the user to pretty much configure everything they have to configure (.msi)
Second place in my opinion is shared by Mac and Linux. Both either don't give you options, or are pretty weird to configure for the basic user.
This is just my opinion though, feel free to disagree.
that's okay for 3 hours of work so far.
like 10 in total

no idea
even though it's not wine
and cider apperantly Apfelwein
we just call that Apfelschorle
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apfelwein
so it's my fault
that translates to cider
and that is apple wine
mum said its Apfelwein
OH I KNOW WHY
nah
it also tastes like the memory I have of wine
mum said it's wine
but this wine taste is disgusting
it has apple mixed with it
the rhubarb taste is OK
I got some red rhubarb wine rn and this wine taste is so fucking disgusting
what do you think of wine
it's literally disgusting
wine tastes like shit
mh
as an example: I get a J and a 10, the program tells me that there is a possibility of a royal flush
since if I know I got a good set and at least a small chance of a full house, I can make decision faster and probably with less error quote
I think it could be
if I get a pair my chances of a full house, a three/four of a kind are higher than if I don't get one
It can
1 round starts, get your 2 cards, which you then enter into the program, the program then proceeds to tell you the chance of getting a royal flush, flush etc. and if you should call of fold, if you call, you proceed to enter thr 3 public cards and it tells you again, how good your chances of winning are, and if you should call of fold
ok lemme give you a better explanation
and if it's a website you just select the card
either if it's a cli tool with your keyboard by pressing the according numbers, with the type and the value as format
then you cab input the public deck and it'll give you more statistics
you give the program your deck and it calculated the chance of getting a good hand
poker statistics
so basically
ttun gamer, I got an idea and I need you to rate it
being rude is not a very top g behavior of you

hey dot what's the distance to x
I bet I could just do the
so it's basically just searching for a tool and then entering information
that do the circle stuff
there are tools iirc
yeah but I don't really care that much so
I can surely do ot
any distance is OK, if it's on Google maps
I mean stuff like distance from some big ass cities on goopfe maps
nah
they have more than 3 point though ig
google has a tool that does it via latencies
not really
yeah but I need to find him myself
and then creating/using software to locate him
specifically 3
asking dot how far he is from certain cities
I got an idea
Ok so ttun

<@207646629140889601> what is on your mind rn
TTUN, we need to eat
. . .
tun
first request was successfully converted to typera
Sir Ttun
no
( they make the big money )
L8 engineer
the name basiclally says it, it's in te middle of the clinet and the handler
yes
it's a function that runs before you actually handle the request
```js\nhandle("/capybara", () => {\n     // This'd be the middleware\n     const user = getUser()\n})\n```
it basically like this
instead of having the same code for all the routes that require the user, you just put a middleware in front of it
You have multiple requests which require the user to be authenticated, so in this case, you'd need to get the token and then request the user in the database always in the handler
not having to write the same code 100 times over and over
( the request contains the token )
yes
and in the handler I can then access the uer
runs before this code becaue I defined it as middleware
this code
middleware runs before the actual code of the request, so you can inject stuff like user
then runs middleware and after that executes actual code
gamer.com sees: TTUN SENT MESSAGE  ! !!  !!
you send request to gamer.com
OK so
It's the simplest shit ( I knew this when I first touched express ( with 11 ) )
and I wrote middleware
I drank water
. . . ttun
you're quite literally personality shaming me rn

MISOPHONIA

Hello!
<@207646629140889601> I have a serious question. What would you call the interface for methods of executing trades?
Executors sounds so harsh.
says he makes a "lua" like language, actually makes a lisp like language
also he's german
I can't fucking believe you already spent more than 4 hours today on this üíÄ
üíÄüíÄüíÄ
looking up to tuner üíÄüíÄ
Im pretty sure that I didnt fall this deep
(network engineers are factually worse than software/data/system integration/hardware engineers
mf really spent 7 hours doing this shit üíÄ
I don't care about the results <:kek:923235548326412358>
You're wasting your time..
Fuck this took way to long to implement
Indeed! This makes pattern recognition easier to do
Now I can combine indicators
Maybe I should do something against this
This happening is completely logical but not really necessary, just makes pattern recognition harder
Chris..-
Wow!
intentional misinformation
tuner...
You're getting robbed
grab the next 1911 and go check
in always up until normally 3am
to get stuff done
today's an exception
because new year
Anyways I have to complain about a certain thing
I wanted to do papertrading today l
with a program called trading view, which allows me to have indicators and an overall good overview of the price
this program supports multiple exchanges, which is logical as crypto is based on supply and demand of the exchange, so each of them have different prices
Now, all these big exchanges don't offer demo-accounts, and the ones that do, either have a scuffed interface, or their fucking prices on their website don't even update
I guess I'll have to write a simple simulator website on my own... At least some big exchanges provide their data for free...
or even better yet
just a cli program
I don't think Ill be needing a website, I mean I have the chart on tradinview
<@207646629140889601> futures or perpetual, what do you find better
Anyways got my trading simulator in cli done
now I'll do some due diligence
and company research
finances
Never could've though that SBF is an idiot üò≥
How can that be!!!
<@535483016546615302> do you really call your teacher "teach" <:kek:923235548326412358> <:kek:923235548326412358> <:kek:923235548326412358> üíÄüíÄ

he certainly does.
I bet you call your teach something stupid
Hello <@207646629140889601> <@698374767043936327>! What is your opinion on trading long-term based on due diligence
how much money do you need to retire
literally how
Schwab told me that a solid amount is 175k
I also calculated how much I'll have at retirement on their website
some American bank
they make good automated company research
If I keep making money like I am right now, and keep my investment strategy, they predict that I'll have 1.9 million buck
https://www.schwab.com/retirement-planning-tools/retirement-calculator
Oh yeah sure, we also have pension where you don't necessarily need to have money saved up to retire, you get your pension if you worked
I mean how much money do you want to retire to have a nice life
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èso you don't want to have a nice vacation at some point?
At least I can go on some trips when I retire <:swaghappy:939491678836895765>
anyways I've come to the conclusion that cryptocurrency is pretty much gambling
especially when trading with derivatives
and leverage
Very nice.
Do you like options or futures more
I'll get used to writing due diligences proficiently and then I'll sell you trading them due diligences
(due diligence is basically conpany research with the intend of buying the company or shares of a conpany)
at least you don't have to spend 30k on a due diligence made by Goldman Sachs
which is in the end basically also just public information compiled into one pdf
do you prefer options or futures (including prepetual futures)
Kotlin compiles to JavaScript
My portfolio should have at least 70% low risk investments (= index funds), and 30% risk investments (=single stocks, commodities, etc.)
This way I have a solid ground to not loose all my money
and have a chance to make more money than the 5% a diversified index portfolio would bring me
and with correct stock allocation and due diligence, a long term run with stocks is barely risky, even though it's totally more risky than index funds
The due diligence I have seen fron big investment banks don't seem to be structured in a way that no one could do a due diligence, I think pretty much everyone with enough time could write them, as there are extreme amounts of websites that provide data about public companies
Drag and Drop API
https://web.dev/drag-and-drop/
they even describe you how you do something like you did
just horizontal
I mean react-draggable seems to use the drag and drop api
and react-draggable is used by trello iirc
and the trello clones also use react-draggable
üíÄ
Yes with index funds I'm betting that the world economy will go up
because thats not predictable
gambling
thinking that a stock will go up based on catalysts also is gambling, as the AAPL stock surely won't go up when they release their VR/AR thing
Gambling isn't predictable, while investing allows you see facts which will most likely affect the stock price
also what else do you want to do against inflation üíÄ
I think you don't understand the thing behind due diligence
You don't invest in the stock, you invest in the company, and if your due diligence results in the fact that you dislike the company, you don't invest
that's why due diligence exists: if the financial position of a company is good, their product has quality, they manage their employees good, the stock most likely goes up
and this isn't just logical thinking, guess how Warren Buffet got his billions? By betting on the stock market? sure!
Sure, but the company will surely recover from that
seems to have recovered
you think too short-term
good investments always bring good return, you just need to have patience and find a good company with a good product you would actually want to support
I might go as far and say that a big investment bank saw their financial position
and why should they literally take the free money
Not investing is just stupid, you just get your money eaten away
while with investing in an index fund, you at least get to keep your money
which is also nearly risk-free
They're even about to rise üíÄ
Such scandals don't work on the long-term

should've just used anime.js

the drag and drop api should give you some methods and from then on you can just use the transform property or even better yet anime.js

that's how react-draggable works if I am not mistaken

but it would be cool
yeah because they bought the tld
we surely won't be able to afford any custom tld any time soon
ICAAN
yes
google did it too
there also should be an oracle tld iirc
ok so you would need to apply for a custom tld and then they quote you, which surely won't be a number below 7 figures
that's a completely different thing
a domainless website would also fuck up dns
there isn't.
There's only a handshake version of .js
but handshake is bullshit and not standardized
so you can't access it without changing your dns server
handshake is another decentralized shit platform
this time it's for domains and custom dns regions

Kubernetes, Nomad, Terraform, MinIO (S3), AWS/Azure/GCP/Vultr, and all the other stuff I sometimes recommend to learn. Can't think of anything else rn, but there's more
Acorn
I used everything except for Terraform, as it requires me to pay the cloud people extensively
Very nice of them
saves a lot of time, so I heard
also save your time writing kubernetes manifests and just use acorn.
It's made by the ex-founder of Rancher
(he's very smart and wise)
actually you should at least learn the basics of them kubernetes manifests if you plan to use it at work, but for personal projects acorns is the best option imo

upwork seems better than fiverr
more professional

yes
both work on upwork iirc
the major difference is the pay; upwork people mostly pay per hour, so I heard
no idea
yes ofc
<:kek:923235548326412358>
the clients budget is higher though
also gumroad seems like a nicer platform, which was made worse by them taking 10% on every sale since January 1st. The platform kinda allows you to do everything, sell products, courses, services etc.
Fiverr has a credit system, so when the clients pay and you finish the order, you get credits, which you can withdraw
to paypal, your bank account and a bunch of other stuff I forgot

you should really use the generator though

yes
yeoman
because there's a separate server for the language suggestions
thats why its called language server
vscode also has a tutorial on that
I can't tell you shit
I did it once by just following the docs
can't tell you more about it, especially because I forgot 97,87% of it
I literally told you 3 times already that I can only tell you to refer to the docs
<@207646629140889601>
the process of highlighting, autocompleting etc. is mostly split into the server and the client, the client is in this case the plugin, which just interfaces with the server. This infrastructure is there to allows the language server to be reused for different clients (e.g. you wrote one for, and implemented it in vscode, now you can take it and implement the server in neovim, without rewriting the actual tokenizing, highlighting etc. part)
the server just does tokenizing and autocompleting
vscode: Hello lsp I would like the autocompletion, this is my code: CODE
lsp: there you go: [AUTO_COMPLETE, ...]
theoretically
would be a pain in the ass to implement the protocol though
and the language would need to be running at all times
so I would advise against it
same thing
you would need to implement the protocol
so you would need a network package in your language
no idea
would be cool to have them though
